# ETL-SQL Product Roadmap

This document tracks future product tracks and candidate phases. When development begins, the next
actionable phase is moved to `TODO.md`. Shipped work belongs in `CHANGELOG.md` and the release notes
under `docs/releases/`.

The enterprise operating model, authority hierarchy, trust boundaries, and progressive deployment
promise are defined in
[`docs/architecture/roadmaps/Enterprise_Platform_Strategy.md`](docs/architecture/roadmaps/Enterprise_Platform_Strategy.md).

## Future Candidate Phases

### Portal — Governance Dashboard

Finish the data-steward-first dashboard described in
[`Governance_Dashboard_Strategy.md`](docs/architecture/roadmaps/Governance_Dashboard_Strategy.md).
The current production module is a visual prototype: it substitutes demo assets when the
stewardship API fails and keeps findings, decisions, glossary terms, badges, scans, and scoring
settings only in browser memory.

Replace those placeholders with authorized, audited, durable Portal APIs. The work is complete only
when role and API tests cover the mutation boundaries, UI tests cover live and failure states, and
the production surface never presents demo records as governance evidence.

### Portal — Quarantine Row Access

**Problem.** `DataQualityController.GetQuarantineRows` runs `SELECT * FROM {target}` inside a fresh
in-process `ExecutionSession`. That session is constructed with an empty connection dictionary and
never calls `Evaluator.LoadSessionState`, so it restores nothing from the producing run: no
connections, no temp tables, no session variables. Every real capture target therefore fails —
a connection-qualified target (`warehouse.dbo.quarantine_users`) raises `Unknown source: warehouse`,
and a `#temp` target is silently auto-created as an empty in-memory table, which is worse: the
steward reads "no rows" as "nothing was quarantined". Pre-projection capture plus in-Portal editing
is the strongest part of the remediation workflow, and it is unavailable exactly where quarantine
data actually lives.

The current queue marks these targets **View only**, explains why, and provides review SQL to run
where the connection exists. The remaining product gap is governed, in-Portal access to durable
catalog-backed targets.

**Chosen direction: catalog-backed preview.** Resolve the target through the shared connection
catalog rather than widening the Portal's reach generally.

| Option | Verdict |
| :--- | :--- |
| Rehydrate the producing job's `SessionState` into the preview session | Rejected — restores *every* connection an arbitrary job held, with no bound tied to the manifest, and the state may no longer exist. |
| Resolve the target's connection from the catalog as `SHARED:alias` | **Chosen** — governed path; flows through `SharedConnectionExpander` → `ConnectionSecretResolver` → `ConnectorPolicyAuthorizer`, so policy, secret resolution, and redaction all apply unchanged. |
| Round-trip the read through the orchestrator as a job and return its result set | Deferred fallback — covers ad-hoc script connections the catalog does not know, but needs a result-returning job path and turns an interactive read into an async one. |

Slices:

1. **Manifest provenance.** Add nullable `TargetConnectionAlias`, `TargetConnectorType`, and
   `TargetIsCatalogBacked` to `QuarantineReplayManifest`, written at capture time. Backward
   compatible in the same way the replay-mode fields were: absent means "unknown", which classifies
   as view-only.
2. **Readability consults the catalog.** `QuarantineTargetReadability` gains an
   `IConnectionCatalogProvider` and the caller's `ExecutionIdentity`, and reports readable only when
   the alias resolves, is enabled, and the caller is authorized for it. Every other case keeps its
   existing reason string, so the interim UI needs no change.
3. **Preview session bootstrap.** Prepend
   `CREATE CONNECTION {alias} AS {type}('SHARED:{alias}');` to the preview script. The alias comes
   from the manifest, never from the request, and the statement is still only
   `SELECT * FROM {manifest target}` — not arbitrary SQL. Keep the 15s timeout,
   `MAX_LAST_RESULT_ROWS`, the RLS execution identity, and `SecretRedactor` on the error path.
4. **Kill switch and audit.** Gate the whole path behind `Portal:DataQuality:AllowConnectionPreview`
   (default **off**, so an upgrade does not silently start opening production connections from the
   web tier), and audit each preview read the way dispositions are audited today — reading raw
   quarantined source rows is an access event, not a page view.
5. **Tests.** A **happy-path** read is the first requirement, not the last: every existing
   `quarantine/rows` test asserts a rejection, so the catalog-backed path needs positive coverage
   before it can be considered functional. Then: catalog miss, disabled entry, feature switch off,
   unauthorized identity, and a redaction assertion on the failure path.
6. **Docs + sandbox.** Administration guide: which connections become previewable, what the switch
   does, and what is audited. Flip the sandbox's view-only fixture to a readable catalog-backed
   target so both states stay developable
   (`tools/ui-sandbox/stories/data-quality-queue.story.js`).

Open decision for the sprint: whether a steward reviewing rows through a catalog connection should
be limited to connections their own role can already reach, or whether `DataQualityStewardAccess`
plus a manifest-bound target is authority enough. This changes slice 2's authorization check.

### Portal — Other Known Gaps

Collected while walking the Portal as a steward would use it. Ordered by how much each affects
day-to-day use.

1. **Submitted jobs disappear.** Replay and disposition actions report
   `Disposition job {id} submitted` and stop there — no status, no link into job history. A steward
   cannot tell whether the release they just made actually applied. The queue should follow the job
   to a terminal state, or at minimum link to it.
2. **The trend panel re-parses a display string.** `ParseRuleFailures` reconstructs per-rule
   failures by splitting the `DataQualityFailures` history payload on `;`, `:`, and `=`. That format
   exists for humans reading run history; it already needed careful handling because rule text
   contains both `:` and `=` (a `MATCHES` regex). v2 records per-column run metrics — the trend
   should read those instead of parsing prose.
3. **No rule visibility in the Portal.** `SHOW DATA QUALITY RULES` is an engine statement only, so a
   steward who lives in the Portal cannot see which rules protect which columns — the thing they
   most need when a quarantine rate jumps. Wants a read-only endpoint plus a panel beside the trend.
4. **Every preview spins a full engine.** Each request lexes, parses, lints, and evaluates through a
   new `ExecutionSession`. Acceptable at current volume; worth revisiting before any endpoint like
   this becomes a polled or dashboard-refreshed surface.
