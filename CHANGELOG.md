## [0.8.0] — 2026-05-25

### Added

**Connector Testing & Certification**
- **Connector Certification Matrix**: Formal 4-class certification framework (`MetadataOnly`, `MockedIntegration`, `LocalRealIntegration`, `DockerRealIntegration`) across all 21 connectors. `Connector` and `CertificationClass` traits on every test class enable targeted release gate selection.
- **FTP Docker real-integration**: `delfer/alpine-ftp-server` Testcontainers fixture covering connection, upload/download round-trip, root listing, wrong-password provider-failure wrapping, and `PORT` option handling.
- **REST API real-integration**: Loopback HTTP server tests for PUT and DELETE requests with Basic, Bearer, and API key auth; PUT body verification.
- **Azure Blob (Azurite) integration**: Smoke, upload/list round-trip, download, bad account key, expired SAS token, and host-allowlist enforcement.
- **SMTP (Mailpit) integration**: Docker-backed send-and-verify, multi-row batch, connection-refused and host-allowlist failure paths.
- **BigQuery emulator integration**: `ghcr.io/goccy/bigquery-emulator` Testcontainers coverage for T1 smoke plus T2–T4 unit coverage (invalid credentials, credential masking, host allowlist).
- **Snowflake emulator integration**: Emulator-backed tests plus unit coverage for JWT connection properties, host suffix normalisation, and host-allowlist enforcement. Fixed a `StackOverflowException` in `SnowflakeDataSource.CreateCommand`.
- **Parquet/Avro corrupt-file coverage**: Real-file negative-path reads that verify corrupt provider errors are wrapped as sanitised `ExecutionException`s.
- **Exception wrapping (T4)**: Provider-exception wrapping verified for 11 connectors: ORACLE, ODBC, EXCEL, PARQUET, AVRO, FTP, AZURE_BLOB, API, SMTP, REPORTPORTAL, ORCHESTRATOR.

**`etl-sql doctor` Enhancements**
- `--profile quick|full` — quick profile stays fast; full profile runs report-manifest smoke, PDF export smoke, Graphviz/browser capability checks, and service probes (Report Portal `/health`, Orchestrator `/health`, SMTP, SFTP, Azure Blob).
- `--json` output mode for automation.
- `--strict` flag returns non-zero on warnings.
- Full runtime-path write checks, parser/engine/linter/security/encryption/file/report-asset/Node/portal-DB health probes.

**Scale Certification Harness**
- `scripts/Test-ScaleCertification.ps1` runs smoke/standard/stress tiers with `CERT_ROW_SCALE`-driven row counts.
- Certified scenarios: external sort, aggregate, join, temp-table spill, result cap, window spill, CUBE grouping-set spill, scalar subquery cache, and non-persistent spill cleanup after success and forced failure.
- Each scenario asserts correct row count, `TotalSpilledBytes > 0` for spill paths, tier-derived managed-memory bounds, and cleanup completion.
- `FullyMaterializingDml` warnings for uncapped `MERGE`/`UPDATE`/`DELETE` paths documented with explicit limits.
- 50k-row `CREATE DATASET` Parquet snapshot/reload certified with row count and checksum (`Cert_Smoke_ReportDatasetSnapshotReload_50kRows`).

**Persistent Lineage & Stewardship Catalog**
- `ILineageCatalogStore` interface with `SaveLineageAsync`, `GetHistoryForTableAsync`, `GetHistoryForTagAsync`; implemented in `SQLiteJobHistoryStore` (`LineageHistory` table, auto-migrated).
- New statements: `SHOW LINEAGE HISTORY FOR TABLE <name>` and `SHOW LINEAGE HISTORY FOR TAG <key> [= 'value']`, both supporting `LIMIT` and `INTO #t`.
- Portal Lineage catalog view: target/source/source-file/tag/job queries, column and date filters, tags list, jobs list, source-file links, report links, CSV export, and saved query presets.
- Lineage catalog persistence for portal in-process report executions, bundle publish events, and `CREATE DATASET`/`CREATE VISUAL` runtime events.
- Authenticated portal APIs for table, source, source-file, tag, and job lineage history with report context attached.

**Report Portal Hardening**
- Concurrent snapshot/history/report/list reads during refresh and duplicate-refresh debounce verified by integration test.
- `EXPORT_CSV` and `EXPORT_PDF` audit events added to `ExportController`.
- Read-only report access: snapshot/export allowed, execute/refresh denied, private dataset ACL filtering on dependency and dataset-list endpoints.
- Report history modal updated with dedicated table rendering and horizontal scroll fallback for long hashes.

**Snippet Library Phase 4**
- 13 new built-in snippets covering common connector, lineage, reporting, and scheduling patterns.
- User-defined snippets loaded from disk at startup.
- TUI tab-stop navigation inside snippet placeholders.
- F1 reference integration: snippets surface in `HELP SNIPPETS` and the snippet reference panel.

**Documentation**
- Doc sanity tests: SQL blocks in `Grammar.md`, `Syntax_Index.md`, and all bundled help files parse without syntax errors; help link resolution verified; stale roadmap language guardrail for reference docs.
- Connector Standards doc updated to reflect XML streaming refactor (Rule 7 compliance).
- Scale certification claims page added (`Docs/Standards/ScaleCertification.md`).
- SLT corpus coverage documented in `Docs/Standards/SLT_Coverage.md`.

### Fixed
- **Snowflake StackOverflow**: `SnowflakeDataSource.CreateCommand` was recursively calling itself; fixed to delegate to the underlying connection.
- **VS Code password prompt**: "requires an interactive console" error when an `ENC:`-protected connection was opened in VS Code; password masking now works via the VS Code input mechanism.
- **Test coverage gate**: Coverage had slipped below 70%; restored to 70.8%+ with T4 exception-wrapping test additions.
- **SLT DML gap**: Added `dml.test`, `insert.test`, and `merge.test` to the SLT corpus; `MergeStatementHandler` was missing from `SltRunner` and is now registered. All 40 SLT files pass.
- **Oracle negative-path coverage**: `gvenzl/oracle-free` Testcontainers fixture extended with missing-table and invalid-SQL failure paths.
- **Azure Blob expired SAS**: `AzureBlobIntegrationTests` now generates and tests an expired account SAS token.

### Changed
- **XML streaming refactor**: XML connector refactored from full-DOM accumulation to streaming `XmlReader`, eliminating full materialisation of large XML files (Rule 7).
- **ODBC/Excel async exceptions**: Accepted exceptions documented with inline comments in `OdbcConnector.cs` and `ExcelDataSource.cs`.
- **`SET SHOW_SECRETS`**: `SET SHOW_PASSWORDS` is now an alias for the preferred `SET SHOW_SECRETS` form.
- **`v0.7.0` baseline notes moved**: Migration Guide updated to reflect 0.8.0 as the current baseline.

## [0.7.0] — 2026-05-18

- **Unified IntelliSense**: 
    - New dot-aware suggestion engine with priority-based ranking and member-access discovery.
    - LSP support for `@`-prefix tag completions and documentation hovers.
    - Finalized purge of unstable semantic features for improved stability.
- **VS Code Preview**: Support for new chart types (Bubble, Radar, Candlestick, Map) and improved sidebar variable discovery.
- **Report SQL Audit**: Comprehensive rewrite of `Report_SQL_Guide.md` and inline help files to match current production state.
- **Deployment Packaging**: Integrated Windows MSI/ZIP, Linux `.deb`/ZIP, macOS DMG/ZIP, and platform-targeted VSIX generation into the release pipeline.

### Fixed
- **Multi-Select Regression**: Fixed a duplication bug where legacy dropdown logic was overwriting the new checkbox-list implementation.
- **Markdown Rendering**: Resolved issues where Markdown tables were displayed as raw text due to library interface mismatches.
- **IntelliSense Regressions**: Fixed missing connector option suggestions and asterisk expansion failures.
- **Portal State Bugs**: Resolved "white screen" and state synchronization issues in the report portal.

- **Notebook Reliability**: Fixed "REPL process exited unexpectedly" and communication deadlocks by implementing atomic process lifecycle management and heartbeat checks.
- **Protocol Standardization**: Migrated REPL communication to strict PascalCase JSON with mandatory CRLF endings for Windows pipe stability.

### Changed
- **Sample Reorganization**: Expanded the curated `samples/` library and redirected generated sample outputs under `samples/output/` patterns for repository cleanliness.
