# ETL-SQL Development TODO List

Use this list to track active-release bugs, features, hardening tasks, and verification work.
Future-version planning belongs in `ROADMAP.md`; completed work belongs in `CHANGELOG.md`,
release notes, or the relevant implementation/design document.

## v0.17.0 Release

Release focus: promote the actionable roadmap work into the sprint, finish the workstation editor,
improve authoring surfaces, and close the maintainability work that makes future connector and Portal
changes safer.

### Review Workflow and Data Stewardship

- [ ] **Phase 1: Stewardship Catalog.**
      Define the governed tag catalog for standard stewardship metadata (`@owner`, `@steward`,
      `@contact`, `@domain`, `@classification`, `@quality`, `@pii`, `@phi`, `@pci`, and
      `@sensitive`) with type, allowed values, aliases, required scopes, and deprecation metadata.
      Add lint/runtime validation for those standard tags while preserving an escape hatch for custom
      organization tags. Add catalog queries for missing owner, steward, contact, classification, and
      quality metadata. Document the administrator posture and script-first usage in the stewardship
      strategy/reference docs.

### Release Verification

- [ ] Run the fast lane: `.\scripts\test-lane.ps1 -Lane fast -NoRestore`.
- [ ] Run the full pre-release lane:
      `.\scripts\Test-PreRelease.ps1 -IncludeSlt -IncludeDockerIntegration -IncludeStandardScale -BuildInstallers -Platforms win-x64`.
- [ ] Run enterprise hardening certification on Windows and Linux:
      `.\scripts\Test-EnterpriseHardeningCertification.ps1`.
- [ ] Run scale certification for advertised scale claims:
      `.\scripts\Test-ScaleCertification.ps1 -Tier Standard`.
- [ ] Run the recovery drill and retain the report: `etl-sql admin restore --validate --report recovery-report.json`.
- [ ] Run HA failure certification and retain the transcripts: `etl-sql admin ha-soak fault-run` then `etl-sql admin ha-soak validate`.
- [ ] Confirm the documentation boundary guards still pass:
      `dotnet test tests\ETL-SQL.Tests\ETL-SQL.Tests.csproj --filter FullyQualifiedName~SecurityBoundaryDocTests`.
- [ ] Collect the evidence required by [Enterprise_Release_Evidence_Checklist.md](docs/architecture/decisions/Enterprise_Release_Evidence_Checklist.md)
      — that document is the authoritative list; the entries above are the commands, not a substitute for it.
- [ ] Confirm `CHANGELOG.md`, release notes, sample inventory, and docs reflect v0.17.0 behavior.
