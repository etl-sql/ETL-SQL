# ETL-SQL Development Roadmap
## TUI on-going issues

## VS Code Extension on-going issues
- [ ] **Execute Tree Clear** Each time I execute either all or selected the execute tree should be cleared an should start over.  Currently it just keeps adding to the tree view.
- [ ] **Variable Values** Variable values are not displayed on the sidebar.  I think the code is in place but they are not displayed.
- [ ] **Export to CSV** Export to csv should be added to the results grid context menu. It was but at some point it seems to have disappeared.
- [ ] **Settings cleanup** Setting is really messy, it should just need a pointer to where the exe files are and do you want to show debugging or not.  I don't know of any other options needed at this time. 
- [ ] **Add .rptsql extension** rptsql extension is not supported.  Its really the same as etlsql extension except a button should appear so that the user can preview the report in a new panel.  Should work like Markdown preview.  The report preview is already an option so there shouldn't be much to do here.

## Phase 9 Report-SQL — Post-Launch Items

Phases 9A–9D are complete. The following items were deferred as out-of-scope for the initial launch or identified in the Phase 9 risk register as follow-up work.

### Dashboard Behavior
- [ ] **Rpt-4 HOLD** `STRUCTURE` string validation. `CreatePageStatementHandler` and the linter should validate the CSS grid template areas string: every letter in the `MAP(...)` must appear in `STRUCTURE`, and every letter in `STRUCTURE` must appear in the map. Mismatches produce a broken layout silently today.  Note: I would like to get the structure the way I want it first.  Hold on this item for now.

### Documentation
- [ ] **Page structure**  I don't think the STRUCTURE option is working. I'm using the example below and everything just went top to bottom in a single column.  I would like to see a 2x3 grid.  Maybe there needs to be better definition of the structure option.  
```sql
CREATE PAGE <name> AS LAYOUT (
  STRUCTURE = 'grid:2x3',
  MAP (
    'A' = TotalRevenue,
    'B' = RevenueByRegion,
    'C' = RevenueByProduct,
    'D' = UnitsByMonth,
    'E' = SalesTable
  )
);
```
My initial draft was that the STRUCTURE option was listed like this 'A A / B C / D E' to represent a 2x3 grid.  I'm not sure if that's the best way to represent it, but it's what I came up with.  Maybe that's hard to implement but it gives you a better indication of what is happening.  I guess the assumption is it works top 

- [ ] **Need to add a way to create a new page/tabs**  Currently its rendered as a single page.  Need to be able to generate multiple pages and then we'll need a new structure that acts as the naviation tabs.  
```sql
CREATE PAGE Main AS LAYOUT (
  STRUCTURE = 'grid:2x3',
  MAP (
    'A' = TotalRevenue,
    'B' = RevenueByRegion,
    'C' = RevenueByProduct,
    'D' = UnitsByMonth,
    'E' = SalesTable
  )
);
CREATE PAGE Detail AS LAYOUT (
  STRUCTURE = 'grid:2x3',
  MAP (
    'A' = DetailTable
  )
);
CREATE NAVIGATION Tabs AS (
  PAGE = Main,
  PAGE = Detail
) WITH(TYPE = 'tabs', ORIENTATION = 'horizontal');
```
The navigation could be a tab, sidebar, or other layout.  We should be able to define the type of navigation and the layout of the navigation.
