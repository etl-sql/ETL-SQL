- [ ] **Report portal add Active Directory support**  Need to add the ability to hook credentials with active directory.

- [ ] **Fuzzy Matching — Full Feature Set** — See `Docs/Strategy/FuzzyMatching_Strategy.md` for the complete design. Five phases in recommended order:
    - **Phase 1 — `NORMALIZE()` function** *(go first — highest ROI, smallest scope)*: Domain-aware string preprocessing with presets for COMPANY, PERSON, ADDRESS, PHONE, EMAIL. Eliminates surface variation before any similarity algorithm runs.
    - **Phase 2 — String Similarity & Phonetic Functions**: `SIMILARITY(a, b, algorithm)` supporting JAROWINKLER, LEVENSHTEIN, TRIGRAM, JACCARD, TOKENSORT. Engine-level `SOUNDEX`, `METAPHONE`, `DMETAPHONE`. Foundation for all subsequent phases.
    - **Phase 3 — Blocking Utilities**: `NGRAMS(s, n)` and `NGRAM_TOKENS(s)` to support user-built inverted-index blocking patterns. Documented cookbook recipes for manual block → score → rank pipeline.
    - **Phase 4 — `FUZZY JOIN` syntax** *(biggest ergonomic win)*: `FROM #a FUZZY JOIN #b ON SIMILARITY(...) > 0.80 KEEP BEST 1`. Built-in trigram blocking index; `LEFT FUZZY JOIN` variant; `__score` injected into result. Semantics for threshold/cardinality/ties fully documented in strategy doc.
    - **Phase 5 — Embedding-Based Semantic Matching** *(defer until Phase 4 ships)*: `EMBED(col, endpoint, model)` via pluggable HTTP endpoint (Ollama/OpenAI-compatible). `VECTOR` column type. `SIMILARITY(a, b, 'COSINE')`. For the cases where string algorithms fail entirely (semantic variation).
