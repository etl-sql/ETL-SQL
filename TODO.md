# ETL-SQL Development TODO List

Use this list to track active-release bugs, features, hardening tasks, and verification work.
Future-version planning belongs in `ROADMAP.md`; move a roadmap phase here only when work on that
release begins.

## v0.14.0 — Enterprise Policy Enforcement & Monitoring

Completes the enterprise controls whose protected enrollment and authoritative client runtime shipped
in v0.13.0. Standalone installations must remain unenrolled, unrestricted by organization policy, and
independent of network services.

**Shipped foundation (v0.13.0, do not redo):** machine-level enrollment, protected bootstrap, trust
key, machine identity, enroll/status/unenroll CLI (`4850f3c0`); tenant-bound RSA-PSS signed policy
retrieval, protected cache, rollback/expiry checks, configuration precedence, diagnostics, dynamic
reload, fail-closed host refresh (`9e0dfbc`). All v0.14.0 work consumes `EnterprisePolicyRuntime.Current`
— do **not** introduce a second policy loader or configuration-precedence path.

> **Before starting any item:** verify it against the current code first — some foundations already
> exist (e.g. `SecurityService` path validation, the governance audit outbox, fail-closed audit
> interceptor) and parts of these phases may be partially implemented. Don't treat a roadmap line as
> net-new work until confirmed.
>
> **Scope note:** ROADMAP Phase 6 (Operations Control Plane) is *candidate scope* and stays in
> `ROADMAP.md` — promote the highest-value Phase 6 items here only after Phases 3–5 expose the final
> operational requirements.

### Phase 3: Policy Authority & Operation-Boundary Enforcement

#### 3.1 Policy authority
- [ ] Add an administrator-only policy API and Portal workflow to validate, version, publish, supersede, and retrieve organization policies by tenant/environment.
- [ ] Sign envelopes with an external certificate/key-store reference; never persist an exportable private signing key in the Portal database, configuration export, logs, backups, or support bundles.
- [ ] Authenticate enrolled machines, bind responses to tenant/environment, support client certificates, and reject unknown, revoked, or reassigned machine identities.
- [ ] Preserve immutable published versions and record author, reviewer/publisher, timestamp, policy hash, superseded version, and rollout state.
- [ ] Support staged rollout and emergency rollback by publishing a newer signed version; clients must continue rejecting envelopes with older issuance times.
- [ ] Add policy-authority availability, signing-key rotation, machine revocation, and publication audit coverage.

#### 3.2 Shared enforcement context
- [ ] Define one immutable execution-policy snapshot containing enrollment, policy version/hash, actor, execution mode, script hash, job/correlation ID, and effective governed values.
- [ ] Capture the snapshot when execution begins and pass it through CLI, TUI, Report Player, Portal, Orchestrator, child processes, parallel branches, and scheduled jobs.
- [ ] Define policy-refresh semantics for work already running: security revocation and expired policy fail promptly; ordinary limit changes apply no later than the next operation boundary.
- [ ] Return structured allow/deny decisions with policy key, sanitized requested value/target, effective constraint, and correlation data.

#### 3.3 Filesystem enforcement
- [ ] Route all script-driven reads, writes, deletes, moves, copies, archive extraction, directory enumeration, spill, export, snapshot, and artifact paths through one canonical path-authorizer.
- [ ] Enforce approved roots, read/write distinctions, maximum recursive depth, file-operation count, extension/type restrictions, and protected application/system paths.
- [ ] Resolve canonical targets before access and prevent bypass through `..`, relative paths, mixed separators/case, UNC/device paths, alternate data streams, symbolic links, junctions, hard links, and archive traversal.
- [ ] Re-check immediately before mutation to reduce check/use races; use handle-based validation where the platform supports it.
- [ ] Keep engine-owned spill/cache paths separate from user-selected destinations while applying explicit policy limits to both.

#### 3.4 Network and connector enforcement
- [ ] Enforce connector allowlists and destination host/port/scheme rules before DNS resolution and connection creation.
- [ ] Protect against DNS rebinding, redirects to denied destinations, proxy bypass, IPv4/IPv6 literal variants, loopback/link-local/private ranges, and credentials embedded in URLs.
- [ ] Apply the same authorization to REST, database, email, SFTP, object storage, remote policy/vault access, and connector-specific discovery/probe operations.
- [ ] Ensure aliases, plugins, saved connections, and connection-string forms cannot bypass connector classification or destination checks.

#### 3.5 Process, Docker, resource, and script-setting enforcement
- [ ] Gate external executables, arguments, working directories, environment inheritance, shell invocation, Docker images/registries, mounts, networks, privilege flags, and host access.
- [ ] Enforce parallelism, recursion, file-operation, email, string/result, memory/spill, execution-time, and other governed resource ceilings at runtime.
- [ ] Prevent `SET`, environment variables, command-line options, report parameters, saved sessions, plugins, and child processes from weakening locked or constrained values.
- [ ] Permit users to choose stricter limits; reject weaker values before execution and retain the enterprise value.
- [ ] Make every denial deterministic across in-process and spawned-process execution.

#### Phase 3 completion gates
- [ ] Every governed key maps to a named enforcement boundary or is removed from the policy schema as non-enforceable.
- [ ] A repository-wide security review finds no direct sensitive operation that bypasses the shared authorizer.
- [ ] Bypass suites cover Windows and Linux paths, links, DNS/redirect behavior, connector aliases, child processes, Docker mounts, script overrides, and concurrent policy refresh.
- [ ] Existing standalone tests prove no enterprise endpoint, certificate, cache, or organization restriction is required when unenrolled.

### Phase 4: Central Security Events

#### Event contract and emission
- [ ] Define a versioned structured security-event schema with stable event ID, severity/type, timestamp, actor/effective identity, host/node, tenant, script/job/correlation IDs, policy version/hash, sanitized target, decision, and reason.
- [ ] Emit events for override attempts, denied filesystem/network/connector/process/Docker operations, policy signature/expiry/rollback failures, stale or unavailable policy, machine enrollment changes, and repeated resource-limit violations.
- [ ] Separate security events from ordinary diagnostic logs and existing governance audit records while preserving correlation between all three.
- [ ] Redact credentials, query parameters, connection strings, environment values, filesystem data, and exception details before persistence or transport.

#### Durable delivery and monitoring
- [ ] Provide a durable local security-event outbox for every executable, with bounded storage, atomic append, retry, batching, deduplication, jittered backoff, and crash recovery.
- [ ] Deliver to an HTTPS/SIEM collector using machine identity; define acknowledgement and idempotency behavior.
- [ ] Add Windows Event Log and syslog/structured-file sinks for bootstrap failures that occur before HTTPS delivery is available.
- [ ] Support policy-controlled severity filters so enterprises can forward security warnings/denials without centrally shipping all diagnostic logs.
- [ ] Add optional fail-closed thresholds for terminal delivery failure, oldest-event age, pending count, and outbox bytes; standalone mode remains local-only by default.
- [ ] Expose queue health, last delivery, failures, drops, and collector reachability through diagnostics and fleet status.

#### Phase 4 completion gates
- [ ] Fault-injection tests cover collector outage, duplicate delivery, acknowledgement loss, corrupt outbox state, disk pressure, process crash, redaction, and recovery.
- [ ] A denial is blocked first and then reported; no enforcement decision depends on successful remote logging unless fail-closed monitoring is explicitly enabled.
- [ ] Documentation includes example mappings for common SIEM products without coupling the core event contract to one vendor.

### Phase 5: Certification & Operations

#### Certification lanes
- [ ] Add Windows and Linux enterprise certification lanes for enrollment, signed retrieval, cache/offline operation, dynamic refresh, operation enforcement, and event delivery.
- [ ] Certify Portal, Orchestrator, CLI, TUI, Report Player, Report Builder, Language Server, scheduled jobs, spawned runners, and parallel execution.
- [ ] Run malicious-input and bypass drills covering policy tampering, stale/expired policy, signing-key rotation, machine revocation, path/link races, DNS rebinding, connector aliases, Docker escape-oriented options, and log injection.
- [ ] Prove standalone regression behavior with no enrollment, no enterprise network calls, and unchanged local workflows.

#### Deployment and recovery
- [ ] Document policy-authority deployment, signing-key custody/rotation, machine enrollment/revocation, service-identity permissions, staged rollout, emergency policy publication, and unenrollment governance.
- [ ] Document cache and outbox backup/restore rules; restored machines must not duplicate machine identity or silently reuse credentials in another environment.
- [ ] Define upgrade ordering and compatibility across bootstrap, envelope, policy, event, and collector schema versions.
- [ ] Provide outage runbooks for policy authority, certificate expiry, invalid publication, SIEM outage, disk exhaustion, and fail-closed fleet recovery.
- [ ] Add support-bundle diagnostics that expose versions, hashes, timestamps, and health without policy payload values, trust material, credentials, or sensitive event targets.

### v0.14.0 release gates
- [ ] Complete threat-model and senior security review with all high-severity findings resolved.
- [ ] Pass full functional, performance, migration, recovery, enterprise certification, and standalone regression suites.
- [ ] Confirm documentation never claims OS-level containment against administrators or arbitrary alternate executables; mandate WDAC/AppLocker or equivalent controls where that boundary is required.
